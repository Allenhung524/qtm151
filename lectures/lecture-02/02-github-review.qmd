# Overview of GitHub functions {background-color="#2d4563"}

## Learning Objectives
### By the end of this lecture, you will be able to:

<br>

1. Understand the difference between cloning and forking a repository​
2. Learn how to remove cloned repos​
3. Understand the GitHub workflow: change, commit, push, fetch, pull​
4. Learn how to keep a forked repository updated​
5. Understand what a virtual environment is and how to create one if needed​

## How to access and edit a remote repository

- **Access**: download a remote GitHub repository to your local computer to work on it​
- **Edit**: make local changes to the repository and update them to the cloud​

There are two ways to access a repository:​

- Cloning ​
- Forking - We will use forking in this course​

## Cloning

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=50%}
- Makes a [local copy]{.alert} of a repository, not your own copy
- Think of it as [downloading a repository]{.alert} onto your local computer
- Unlike forks, clones reference the original repository: you can't push changes to it unless you have permissions from the owner
- If you do have permissions, you can [overwrite]{.alert} the content of the remote repository

## Cloning example

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=50%}
::: {style="font-size: 27px;"}
- Example repo: <https://github.com/danilofreire/qtm151-example-repository>

- We can clone the repo using GitHub desktop
  - It [does not create a remote copy]{.alert} of the repo in my GitHub page​

- If the users cloning the repo have [write access]{.alert} they can replace files and folders in the remote GitHub repo​

- The purpose of cloning is often to [contribute directly to the original repo]{.alert}​ or [work offline]{.alert}

## Forking

<br>

- Creates [your own copy]{.alert} of a repository in your remote GitHub page​

- Your own copy means that you will be able to [contribute changes to your copy of the repository without affecting the original repository!​]{.alert}

- Often used to [create a personal version of a project for custom modifications]{.alert}
  - You can then [submit a pull request]{.alert} to the original repository to suggest changes​

## Forking

## Forking example

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=50%}
::: {style="font-size: 27px;"}
- Example repo: <https://github.com/danilofreire/qtm151-example-repository>
- We can fork the repo using the GitHub page
  - It creates a remote copy of the repo on your GitHub
  - You can then clone the repo to your local computer and work on it
  - You can push changes to your remote repo
  - See the [GitHub Tutorial](https://github.com/danilofreire/qtm151/blob/main/tutorials/03-github-tutorial.pdf) for more details

## Comparing cloning and forking

<br>

| Feature                | Cloning                                         | Forking                                        |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Local Copy**         | Yes                                             | No (initially only on GitHub)                  |
| **Direct Collaboration** | Yes (if permissions allow)                     | No (requires pull requests)                    |
| **Synchronisation**    | Yes (with the original repository)              | Yes (can fetch updates from the original)      |
| **Control**            | Limited (depends on permissions)                | Full (over the forked copy)                    |
| **Use Case**           | Contributing directly, local development        | Independent development, contributing via PRs  |
| **Includes**           | All files, branches, commit history             | All files, commit history, but no issues or PRs|

## Removing cloned and forked repositories

<br>

- If you cloned or forked a repository and no longer need it, [you can delete the local copy​]{.alert}
- Deleting the local copy [does not affect the remote repository​]{.alert}
- You can also delete the remote repository if you have write access to it​ ([be careful!]{.alert})
